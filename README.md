# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

**Intro**

This is our 3rd project "Spots" and is made using VScode with the help of Figma. It is a profile page that can be displayed easily using computers, tablets and cell phones. Users can update profile images with their names and brief description. Users can also add pictures to share with other people and let them know what the post is about and then people have the option to like the photo if they feel.
